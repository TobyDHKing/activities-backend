## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run Database Setup

    ```
    node database_setup.js
    ```
    This can be exited after running

3. Start the app 

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

You will find some debug prints to ensure the app is working

ENSURE you run the database setup first.
If not dont worry just delete the database.sqlite file and go to step 2
